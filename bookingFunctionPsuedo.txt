This pseudocode is running under a number of assumptions, feel free to note
things that you would consider important to the process here if you have any
ideas.
Thanks, Zac.

1. User clicks into the booking page, a number of checks are done before the
  user sees the page.
2. Check 1 is for any days in the database that are marked as either public
  holidays or days that are booked out entirely (unlikely to be the case)
3. Check 2 is for any days that have bookings within the day, these days will
  require extra work from the code to present times for certain services as
  already taken.
4. Check 3 might require us to take into account extra staff who are assigned
  this thing or that thing (specialized in one service or another).
  This check might become the most difficult as we may need to have a staff
  member call the user if the time does not suit, and arrange another time.
5. Check 4 checks the user inputs after the fact, and makes sure that they
  have left staff sufficient details to contact them for confirmation or
  troubles with the booking (there might be a final step on the staff side to
  confirm the final steps so that contact has been made before finalization).
6. Check 5 checks the relevant database tables and ensures that no missteps have
  occurred in the process, that the booking time is unoccupied, and that the
  modification was indeed successful.
7. User is likely to be emailed an initial booking confirmation email, informing
  them of any other steps likely to occur, their booked time and date, the
  amount to be owed at arrival, and a booking number perhaps.
